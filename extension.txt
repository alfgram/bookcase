For my extension I have altered bookcase.c to not produce any children which have already appeared in this list. 
This appears to increase the runtime of the program however, it reduces memory use as the list is a lot shorter
having no repeated bookcase arrangements.

Type "make all" to build bookcase.c and extension.c with all flag combinations.
